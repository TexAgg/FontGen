# FontGen
Generating fonts using a neural net.
See [FontGen.pdf](FontGen.pdf) for more information.

## Data
The dataset I used can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B0GtwTQ6IF9AU3NOdzFzUWZ0aDQ).
The final model I created can be downloaded [here](http://bit.ly/2BGTBW1).

## Running
First you need to install the dependencies with
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
and then, with Python 2.7, run
```
python main.py
```
You'll want to make sure you have the data downloaded as well.
